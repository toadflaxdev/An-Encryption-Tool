Linaria Encryption is a program that takes a string containing characters of A-Z and 0-9, and sends the encryted data to your
local machine. To retrieve the data, you can run .exe, which will display whatever data is stored locally. This info is also sent to 
your clipboard.

You can give the .exe a try via /NPS_Encryption/Program
